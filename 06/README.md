# Class 6 - Scraping (cont'd)

+ HW3
+ Scraping Columbia's adjuncts page

## HW3

+ **Instructions:** Download HW3 from [Github](https://github.com/ledeprogram/data-and-databases). You will need to enter the code into the empty cells to produce the desired outcome. Save to your Github repo.
+ The HW focuses on a [toy example html page](http://static.decontextualize.com/widgets2016.html)
+ Eventually, you want your data to look like a **list of dictionaries**. This is a very common data structure that you will encounter again and again.
+ In this assignment, you will be moving your data from html into a list of dictionaries.
+ In Allison's desired output, some strings have a 'u' next to them -- ignore this! The 'u' should not appear in your output.

## Scraping the Columbia J-School Faculty Page

+ Check out the Jupyter notebook to see how we scraped the [Columbia faculty page](http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/10/10?category_ids%5B%5D=2&category_ids%5B%5D=3&category_ids%5B%5D=37)!
