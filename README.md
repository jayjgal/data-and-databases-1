# Lede 2016: Data & Databases

**Description:** Class notes from Lede 2016's Data and Databases course

+ These notes aren't meant to replace [Allison's very thorough notes](https://github.com/ledeprogram/data-and-databases/) or your own notes from class -- use these as a supplement to help you fill in the gaps or backtrack on a code sequence we did in class.

Slack me if you have questions!
